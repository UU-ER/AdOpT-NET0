Model Diagnostics
=====================================
Often, models have numerical problems, are infeasible or have other issues. The module diagnostics helps to identify
some of these problems. Before deploying the tools, you need to initialize a logger.

.. automodule:: src.diagnostics.logger
    :members:

.. automodule:: src.diagnostics.check_infeasibilities

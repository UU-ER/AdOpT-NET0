Typical Day Clustering
=====================================
To reduce the temporal resolution of the model, the input data can be clustered into typical design days as described in
Gabrielli et al. (2018). Optimal design of multi-energy systems with seasonal storage. Applied Energy, 219, 408â€“424.
`doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.142 <doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.142>`_.

The algorithm is implemented in a sub-class of the DataHandle class. The energybalance, storage technologies 'STOR' and
renewable technologies 'RES' as well as networks are always modelled at full resolution. Other technologies are
modelled with a reduced resolution.

Examplary Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need to define the system topology and the input data before clustering the data. Then you can initialize
an instance of the :func:`.ClusteredDataHandle` class and pass it to the :func:`.EnergyHub` class:

.. testcode::

    import src.data_management as dm

    # Define topology and data (not shown here)

    # Set configuration (cluster into 40 typical days)
    configuration = ModelConfiguration()
    configuration.optimization.typicaldays.N = 40


    # Construct Model and solve
    energyhub = EnergyHub(data, configuration)
    ehub.quick_solve()

Data Preparation
=====================================

When preparing the input data for your model application, you use the following two modules: ``template_creation.py``
and ``data_loading.py``. For the code of these modules, see their respective pages below.

Before the data gets processed by the model, you also have to :ref:`set the Model Configuration<workflow_model-configuration>`.
Regarding this, the options of scaling, clustering and time averaging are elaborated upon in their respective documentation.

Two-stage time averaging algorithm
=====================================
This algorithm solves the model in two stages. In the first stage, input data is averaged over multiple hours and the
model is solved in the first stage with this reduced resolution. In the second stage modelled at full temporal
resolution, technology and network sizes from the first stage serve as a lower bound on the sizes. The approach
is described in Weimann, Gazzani (2022). A novel time discretization method for solving complex multi-energy
system design and operation problems with high penetration of renewable energy.

The algorithm is implemented as a sub-class of the DataHandle class and the EnergyHub class. For using this method in
your solve, adjust the value for the "timestaging" setting in ``ConfigModel.json``, accordingly. For example:


.. testcode::

        "timestaging": {
            "description": "Defines number of timesteps that are averaged (0 = off).",
            "value": 4
        },

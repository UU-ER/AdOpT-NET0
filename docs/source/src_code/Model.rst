Model Construction & Solving
------------------------------

The model is constructed by calling the ``EnergyHub.construct_model()`` method. This method clearly illustrates the
structure of the model. There are sets of investment periods, nodes and carriers based on the ``topology.json``. Then,
a block is created for each investment period (all investment periods in the set), each network, each node, and for each technologies. The
methods for the block creation are called by the aforementioned ``EnergyHub.construct_model()`` method from the
``.\src\model_construction`` directory (with a separate module for each block type).

Then, these blocks are all linked through :ref:`cost, emissions and energy / material balances<src-code_balances>` by
calling the ``EnergyHub.construct_balances()`` method (again retrieved from the ``.\src\model_construction`` directory).

Finally, the model can be solved using ``EnergyHub.solve()``.

Note: the three steps above are combined in the ``EnergyHub.quick_solve()`` method to quickly construct and solve the
model at once. All of the methods are documented :ref:`here <energyhub_class>`.
